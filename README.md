# scheduleMaker (FIT schedule magic-machine)

To use this incredibly rare thing just put .jar and your schedule .txt file near each other, then type into (Windows variant, I think Linux guys will get it easily) console (command prompt):
#
java -jar schedule.jar GПП-11.txt
#
If your JRE is isnt in the PATH - REKT

If you forgot -jar - REKT

If your console is not in that directory that you need (aaaaah my English) - REKT

Otherwise you'll get a brand new cool and very stylish schedule for your group, u'll become KING of the group 'cause only uuu have cool new colorful schedule and can give it only them who respect u. until someone reads this and do it and get his pretty COOL schedule. then u gonna cry... but don't worry! u have COOOOOOL schedule that u can use every day.
